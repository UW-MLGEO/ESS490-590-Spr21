    "Just like MLPs, each neuron in a CNN receives some inputs, performs a dot product and optionally follows it with a non-linearity. CNNs are designed to have images as inputs. When using fully connected layers, images have too many samples and a fully connected layer would have too many trainable parameters. CNN layers are not 1D hidden layers, they are volume of neurons.\n",

    "* The **input** \"feature map\" is the input data for a given layer. It is 3D for a 2D convolution. The three dimensions are: *height*, *width*, *depth/channels*. For instance, width and heights are the 2D images (e.g. 32x32 pixels), the depth can be the different RGB (1 image per color R, G, B). The ordering of the dimension of the input is captured in the ``data_format`` argument with ``'channel_first'`` . When including 3D data (RGB of images, or multi channels of geophysical measurement's spectrograms), write out the input shape: batch_shape + (channels, rows, cols) if ``data_format='channels_first'`` or batch_shape + (rows, cols, channels) if ``data_format='channels_last'``. The input size should be divisible by 2 many times (32, 64, 96, 224, 512).\n",

In general, the number of filters is greater than the input number of channels: the network heights and widths usually decreases throughout the networks, thus increasing the depth or number of filters does not increase the complexity too much. \n",
    "* The **kernel size** is a list of 2 integer that specifies the height and width of the 2D convolution kernel. If both integers are equal, just use a single integer value. The kernel is a filter that has weights to apply on the input values, each kernel map as 1 bias. Let's take an example of a 3x3 input feature map, a 2x2 kernel size, a 2x2 output feature map.
